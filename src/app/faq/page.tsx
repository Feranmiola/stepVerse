              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                StepVerse stands apart by combining social gamification,
                blockchain technology, and wearable integrations to create a
                seamless fitness experience. Unlike traditional fitness apps,

                rewards for their activities and participate in global fitness
                competitions. Furthermore, the integration of Web3 ensures

              <AccordionContent>
                Yes, StepVerse is free to use for basic fitness tracking and
                participation in daily challenges. However, certain features,
                such as purchasing treasure-hunt tools or staking points for
                competitions, may require in-app purchases using the platformâ€™s
                native token.

                What is the role of blockchain in StepVerse?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Blockchain ensures data security, transparency, and
                decentralized ownership within the platform. StepVerse uses
                blockchain to tokenize rewards (SV Points), facilitate
                peer-to-peer transactions in the marketplace, and securely store
                user data.

                How do I participate in competitions or treasure hunts?

              <AccordionContent>
                To join competitions, users can invite friends or join existing
                challenges. Users set targets, timelines, and stake points
                before the competition begins. For treasure hunts, users
                purchase tools (e.g., treasure bags, telescopes) to explore
                randomized geo-locations for rewards. Both activities are
                designed to make fitness fun and engaging.

              <AccordionContent>
                StepVerse plans to target Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin
                America for its initial rollout while it is available to use
                anywhere in the world. These regions have a high prevalence of
                sedentary lifestyles and limited access to affordable
                healthcare. By addressing these challenges, StepVerse hopes to
                create significant social and economic impacts.

              <AccordionContent>
                At the initial rollout, StepVerse was not built to integrate
                with wearable devices like Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Garmin.
                However, this is one of the important updates that are lined up
                in the future releases to improve user experience.

              <AccordionContent>
                StepVerse's sustainability relies on its tokenized ecosystem,
                which incentivizes users and generates revenue through in-app
                purchases, partnerships with fitness brands, and corporate
                wellness programs. The platform avoids a Ponzi-like model by
                focusing on utility-driven value rather than speculative growth.
